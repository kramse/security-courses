\slide{Internet in a Box}

\hlkrightimage{10cm}{internet-in-a-box.jpeg}

The main purpose of showing this box, are:
\begin{list2}
\item These are standard devices, Juniper EX3300 cheap oldish, works great
\item Managed switches are a must! You can learn by buying cheap ones,\\
like the TP-Link T1500G-10PS  shown, VLAN, SNMP, Syslog ...
\item Multiple systems created using PC Engines APU2C4 (really D4)\\
running OpenBSD, Unbound, Suricata, Zeek, DHCP, \\
router advertisement, PF firewall - explicit and nice ICMPv6 filtering ...
\item Attack systems compact PCs or laptop
\item Creating a home lab is not expensive, \\
bought the Arista 7150 24-port 10G used on ebay
\end{list2}

You should have similar (or better) devices in your production network, and they can be
configured to do a LOT more than you use them for right now

\slide{Network Segmentation -- Firewalls}

\begin{quote}\small
\$ firewall\\

1. (I) {\bf An internetwork gateway that restricts data communication traffic to and from one of the connected networks} (the one said to be "inside" the firewall) and thus protects that network's system resources against threats from the other network (the one that is said to be "outside" the firewall). (See: guard, security gateway.)

2. (O) {\bf A device or system that controls the flow of traffic between networks using differing security postures.} Wack, J. et al (NIST), "Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy", Special Publication 800-41, January 2002.

Tutorial: A firewall typically protects a smaller, secure network (such as a corporate LAN, or even just one host) from a larger network (such as the Internet). The firewall is installed at the point where the networks connect, and the firewall applies policy rules to control traffic that flows in and out of the protected network.
\end{quote}
Source: RFC4949 \emph{Internet Security Glossary, Version 2\\
\link{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949} 2007}

\slide{Continued}
\begin{quote}\small
{\bf A firewall is not always a single computer.} For example, a firewall may consist of a pair of filtering routers and one or more proxy servers running on one or more bastion hosts, all connected to a small, dedicated LAN (see: buffer zone) between the two routers. The external router blocks attacks that use IP to break security (IP address spoofing, source routing, packet fragments), while proxy servers block attacks that would exploit a vulnerability in a higher-layer protocol or service. The internal router blocks traffic from leaving the protected network except through the proxy servers. The difficult part is defining criteria by which packets are denied passage through the firewall, because a firewall not only needs to keep unauthorized traffic (i.e., intruders) out, but usually also needs to let authorized traffic pass both in and out.
\end{quote}
{\footnotesize Source: RFC4949 \emph{Internet Security Glossary, Version 2}\\
\link{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949} 2007}

\slide{What is a packet filter}

We may want to distinguis between different types of firewalls/devices:
\begin{list2}
\item Network layer, we often call them packet filters, stateless
\item Application level, we often call them, stateful filtering and gateways
\item Firewalls are by design a choke point, natural place \\
to do network security monitoring!
%\item Older but still interesting Cheswick chapter 2 PDF
%\emph{A Security Review of Protocols: Lower Layers}\\
%\link{http://www.wilyhacker.com/}
\end{list2}

They are all firewalls -- or firewall devices!

\slide{Definition of firewalls -- Wikipedia}

Another short definition that encapsulates this is found on Wikipedia, and may suffice in many situations. Again there will typically be multiple networks, zones or areas of the networks with varying degrees of trust.
\begin{quote}

{\bf TL;DR Not necessarily a single device}

\begin{quote}
"{\bf Can your firewall flex in the face of change?}\\
Does it harmonize your network, workload, and application security? Does it protect apps and employees in your hybrid or multicloud environment? Make sure you're covered."
\end{quote}

\slide{A firewall -- in the enterprise mindset }

% Single line in firewall,
% cloud with at-sign Internet on the left,\\
% cloud with at-sign LAN on the right
\hlkimage{19cm}{Firewall-enterprise.pdf}

\begin{list2}
\item Even though some vendors suggest they can do everything in a single box, I don't believe them!
\item Truth -- yes, we can do almost anything in software
\item Realization {\bf Your infrastructure is based on multiple components and or devices}
\end{list2}


\slide{Network Protocol Knowledge Needed for Network Security}

To work with network security the following protocols are the bare minimum to know about.

\begin{list2}
\item ARP Address Resolution Protocol for IPv4
\item NDP Neighbor Discovery Protocol for IPv6
\item IPv4 \& IPv6 -- the basic packet fields source, destination,
\item ICMPv4 \& ICMPv6 Internet Control Message Protocol
\item UDP User Datagram Protocol
\item TCP Transmission Control Protocol
\item DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
\item DNS Domain Name System
\end{list2}

These protocols are part of the Internet Protocol suite, or TCP/IP for short. The canonical document describing this is from 1981 RFC-0791 \citetitle{RFC0791}. The protocols were deployed on the internet around 1983.

\begin{list1}
\item Packet filtering are firewall devices filtering on single packet
\item Most \emph{specialized firewall devices} do stateful filtering and more
\item Don't forget IPv6 -- even though you haven't turned it on, it is there
\end{list1}




\slide{Modern Firewalls}

\begin{list1}
\item Basically some filtering between networks or network segments
\item Typically they contain:
  \begin{list2}
   \item Some interface, maybe web interface, often command line interface
\item TCP/IP filtering options -- packets flowing in and out, direction, protocol, ports etc.
\item Should be able to handle both IPv6 and legacy IPv4
\item Often they have predefined rules for common use-cases\\
Is this really a good thing if you can easily configure a bad protocol like Server Message Block to and from the Internet?
\item Most legacy setups use Network Address Translation (NAT) -- NAT is a kludge and bad!
\item Most platforms have extra network related features DHCP servers, DNS caching servers etc.
\end{list2}
\item The firewall devices are mostly allowing some {\bf stateful filtering} which are much easier to configure than a pure network packet filter
\end{list1}

Goal is to implement rules -- a security policy for isolation and data flow

\slide{Sample rules from OpenBSD PF}

\begin{alltt}\tiny
# hosts and networks
router="192.0.2.1"
webserver="192.0.2.80"
homenet="{ 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24 }"
wlan="198.51.100.0/24
wireless=wi0

# things not used
spoofed="{ 127.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/16, 255.255.255.255/32 }"
{\bf
# default block anything
block in all }
# egress and ingress filtering - disallow spoofing, and drop spoofed
block in quick from $spoofed to any
block out quick from any to $spoofed

pass in on $wireless proto tcp from \{ $wlan $homenet \} to any port = 22
pass in on $wireless proto tcp from any to $webserver port = 80

pass out
\end{alltt}

\item Mac OS X uses OpenBSD PF
\item NetBSD IPFilter (IPF) by default and has also NPF, their PF version is outdated
\item FreeBSD PF, IPFW og IPFilter (IPF) \link{http://www.freebsd.org}
\item The other BSDs Net, Free and Mac OS X has older version of the OpenBSD PF, should really be renamed now

\slide{Together with Firewalls - Virtual LAN (VLAN)}

\hlkimage{8cm}{vlan-portbased.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item Managed switches often allow splitting into zones called virtual LANs
\item Most simple version is port based
\item Like putting ports 1-4 into one LAN and remaining in another LAN
\item Packets must traverse a router or firewall to cross between VLANs
\end{list1}

\slide{Virtual LAN (VLAN) IEEE 802.1q}

\hlkimage{15cm}{vlan-8021q.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item Using IEEE 802.1q  VLAN tagging on Ethernet frames
\item Virtual LAN, to pass from one to another, must use a router/firewall
\item Allows separation/segmentation and protects traffic from many security issues
\item Used in most, if not all, Wi-Fi networks -- each SSID has a VLAN behind it
\end{list1}




\slide{Network Access Control -- Connecting clients more securely}

Talking about standard, another useful one:\\
IEEE 802.1x -- Port Based Network Access Control

\hlkimage{7cm}{802.1X_wired_protocols.png}

\begin{list1}
\item Authentication protocol ensures user validation before port access
\item Can authenticate using username and then password or certificate
\item Typically RADIUS and 802.1x which can use LDAP or Active Directory
\item Already used in Wi-Fi networks, so can be turned on for wired Ethernet ports
\end{list1}

\slide{Firewall concepts}

\begin{list1}
\item When writing firewall rules there are differences
\item Some firewalls are \emph{first match} and some are \emph{last match}
\begin{list2}
\item First match -- when the packet being inspected match a rule the action block/pass is performed immediately
\item  Last match  -- whenever a packet matches a rule, mark the block/pass decision, keep going to the last rule, and {\bf then} perform action
\end{list2}
\item So beware which kind of firewall you are working on
\item FreeBSD IPFW is first match
\item OpenBSD PF is last match
\item Linux iptables/netfilter er last match
\end{list1}

\slide{First or Last match firewall?}

\hlkimage{18cm}{images/first-last-match-1.pdf}



\slide{First match - example IPFW}

\begin{alltt}
\hlksmall
00100 16389  1551541 allow ip from any to any via lo0
00200     0        0 deny log ip from any to 127.0.0.0/8
00300     0        0 check-state
...
{\bfseries
65435    36     5697 deny log ip from any to any}
65535   865    54964 allow ip from any to any
\end{alltt}

This is a stateful filtering ruleset, rule 300 checks if an existing connection is known matching the packet incoming

The deny rule in bold show that the current configuration is a \emph{best current practice} default deny

\slide{Last match - example OpenBSD PF}

\begin{alltt}\small
ext_if="ext0"
int_if="int0"
{\bf
block in}
pass out keep state

pass quick on \{ lo $int_if \}

# Allow port http=80 and port domain=53
# on the IP of the IP of the external interface ($ext_if)
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to ($ext_if) port http keep state
pass in on $ext_if proto \{ tcp, udp \} to ($ext_if) port domain keep state
\end{alltt}

This is also a default deny, all packets incoming are maked as block, so unless they are allowed by a later rule -- thrown away

\begin{list2}
\item Drawings -- lots of drawings and topology
\item An addressing plan! This is very important
\item Then use a GUI for your first experience
\item Plan for long term care
\item Plan for updates
\item Systems and services behind the firewall must still be hardened and configured securely
\end{list2}




\slide{Block outgoing traffic too}

\begin{list1}
\item Some services should \emph{not} cross firewalls, at least not to the internet
\item Some services are too \emph{fragile}

\begin{list2}
\item Windows SMB file sharing is \emph{only} for small internal networks
\item Unix NFS is like-wise \emph{only} for internal use
\item Outgoing email should only go via dedicated relays
\item LDAP outgoing, why?! See the log4j CVE-2021-44228
\item Create a list, document them and consider them dead!
\end{list2}
\item Making a positive list of allowed protocols would be best, but may require too many resources to implement and update
\end{list1}

\slide{Special features}

\begin{list2}
\item Network Address Translation - NAT
\item IPv6 functionality is not an option

\item Rules for bandwidth restriction
\item VLAN is a requirement
\item Redundante firewalls -- OpenBSD uses pfsync and CARP
\item VPN like IPsec, L2TP, TLS VPN, Wireguard features
\item Deep inspection -- can maybe filter DNS domains, URLs or similar
\end{list2}

\slide{Proxy servers and Web Application Firewalls (WAF)}

\begin{list2}
\item Filtrering at higher layers is also possible
\item Web proxies for clients can help security a lot -- a centralized filter for everyone

\item Reverse proxies for web applications are called
Web Application Firewalls (WAF) -- and filter incoming web requests, and outgoing answers. Can help with attacks like SQL injection and exfiltration of data
\item Depending on your network it can replace or be combined with filtering on DNS servers, and I would prefer to filter domains with DNS
\item I would also prefer blocking large prefixes of IP destinations using routers/stateless packet filters -- maybe use BGP for distributing \emph{lists}
\end{list2}


\slide{Netflow and Session Logging}

\begin{list2}
\item Netflow is getting more important, more data share the same links
\item Accounting is important
\item Detecting DoS/DDoS and problems is essential
\item Netflow sampling is vital information - 123Mbit, but what kind of traffic
\item NFSen is old and not recommended anymore
\link{http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/}
\item sFlow, short for "sampled flow", is an industry standard for packet export at Layer 2 of the OSI model, \\
\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFlow}
\end{list2}

\item Higher layer attacks like Slowloris and web attacks -- keep sessions running
\item Protect everything without loosing functionality or creating administrative nightmare
\end{list2}

\slide{Availability and Network flooding attacks}

The attacks we are discussing today are:
\begin{list2}
\item {\bf SYN flood} is the most basic and very common on the internet towards 80/tcp and 443/tcp
\item {\bf ICMP and UDP flooding} are the next popular targets -- more similar ones exist
\item Special packets and protocols -- anything that can create \emph{load on systems} work
\item All of them try to use up some resources
\begin{list2}
\item {\bf Memory space} in specific sections of the {\bf kernel, TCP state, firewalls state, number of concurrent sessions/connections}
\item {\bf Interrupt processing} of packets - packets per second (pps)
\item {\bf CPU processing} in firewalls, pps
\item CPU processing in server software
\item {\bf Bandwidth} - megabits per second (mbps)
\item Typically source is spoofed or amplification attacks abusing devices on the Internet
\end{list2}

\hlkimage{12cm}{overview-routing-customer-2015.pdf}

\begin{list2}
\item Transport Layer Attacks TCP SYN flood TCP sequence numbers
\item High level attacks like Slowloris - keep TCP/HTTP connection for a long time.
\item Traffic shaping is available on multiple platforms like switches and routers
\end{list2}


\slide{Designing the protection -- bandwidth and rate limit}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth-5cm}{|p{5cm}|p{7cm}|X|} \hline

TCP & Up to full bandwidth 10Gbps & 192.0.2.0/25 \\\hline
UDP & Less than 1Gbps & 192.0.2.128/25 \\\hline
ICMP & Less than 10Mbps & 192.0.2.0/24 \\\hline
\end{tabularx}


\begin{list2}
\item Create an address plan for your services
\item Monitor your traffic -- how much UDP and TCP do you have, roughly

\item Above is a simplified example -- dig deeper into your traffic
\end{list2}

\slide{Designing the protection -- address families \& protocols }

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth-5cm}{|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{7cm}|X|} \hline
{\bf Address family} & {\bf Protocol} & {\bf Services and ports} & {\bf Prefix}\\\hline
IPv4 & TCP & 25, 80, 8003, 443, 4443 & 192.0.2.0/25 \\\hline
IPv4 & UDP & 53 & 192.0.2.128/25 \\\hline
IPv6 & UDP & 53  & 2001:DB8:ABCD:0053::/60 \\\hline
IPv6 & TCP & 80 443 & 2001:DB8:ABCD:1000::/56 \\\hline
\end{tabularx}

\begin{list2}
\item Direction is also very important -- servers that never initiate connections have fewer requirements
\item How much traffic do you have that uses IPv6 yet? Should an IPv6 DDoS take up all resources?
\item Maybe let IPv4 only use a part, so at least some customers can visit using IPv6?
\item Maybe you can do an allow list for allocated networks, since not all is used yet

\begin{quote}
Reverse path forwarding (RPF) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent IP address spoofing in unicast routing.
\end{quote}
Source: \link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_path_forwarding}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Configuring Unicast RPF Strict Mode}\\
In strict mode, unicast RPF checks whether the incoming packet has a source address that matches a prefix in the routing table, {\bf and whether the interface expects to receive a packet with this source address prefix.}
\end{quote}


%\slide{Juniper RPF check}

%\begin{quote}
%{\bf Understanding Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding}\\
%IP spoofing can occur during a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. IP spoofing allows an intruder to pass IP packets to a destination as genuine traffic, when in fact the packets are not actually meant for the destination. This type of spoofing is harmful because it consumes the destination's resources.

%A unicast reverse-path-forwarding (RPF) check is a tool to reduce forwarding of IP packets that might be spoofing an address. A unicast RPF check performs a route table lookup on an IP packet's source address, and checks the incoming interface.

\begin{quote}
IPv6 address allocations and overall architecture are important parts
of securing IPv6.  Initial designs, even if intended to be temporary,
tend to last much longer than expected.  Although IPv6 was initially
thought to make renumbering easy, in practice, it may be extremely
difficult to renumber without a proper IP Address Management (IPAM)
system.  [RFC7010] introduces the mechanisms that could be utilized
for IPv6 site renumbering and tries to cover most of the explicit
issues and requirements associated with IPv6 renumbering.

{\bf A key task for a successful IPv6 deployment is to prepare an
addressing plan.  Because an abundance of address space is available,
structuring an address plan around both services and geographic
locations allows address space to become a basis for more structured
security policies to permit or deny services between geographic
regions}.  [RFC6177] documents some operational considerations of
using different prefix sizes for address assignments at end sites.

\item You have space, use it!
\end{list2}

\begin{list2}
\item Take the opportunity to re-design your network! Create a design, consider it green field, work towards it!
\item Use /127 for point-to-point links, add loopback addresses on routers, allows filtering of access to management
\item You can also make parts IPv6-only, Veronika McKillop at TROOPERS19 \emph{Microsoft IT (secure) journey to IPv6-only}\\

\slide{OpenBSD PF IPv6 NDP}
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
# Macros: define common values, so they can be referenced and changed easily.
int_if=vr0
ext_if=vr2
tunnel_if=gif0
table <homenet6> { 2001:16d8:ffd2:cf0f::/64 }

# Filtering: the implicit first two rules are
block in all

# allow ICMPv6 for NDP

pass out inet6 proto ipv6-icmp all icmp6-type routersol keep state

# client which uses autoconfiguration would use this instead
#pass in inet6 proto ipv6-icmp all icmp6-type routeradv keep state
#pass out inet6 proto ipv6-icmp all icmp6-type neighbrsol keep state

...  probably not working AS IS
\end{alltt}



\slide{Providing both IPv4 + IPv6 with simple tables}

The OpenBSD PF has an elegant solution for providing the same rules for both protocols, a table of addresses

\begin{alltt}\small
table <webservers> \{ 2001:db8:1:2::80 192.0.2.80 \}
...al logging is of course NOT)

pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to <webserver> port http
\end{alltt}

This will allow 80/tcp on both IPv4 and IPv6

\begin{list2}
\item Best practice, and not that hard to do
\item ACL, filtering and firewalling will create longer lasting protection

You can ask RIPE NCC for an IPv6 provider independent prefix, through a LIR -- I have a LIR!
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item YOU can't request directly, but need to find a RIPE NCC member to request it\\
Hint: Zencurity Aps is a member
\item It will cost you about EUR 100 per year and you will get minimum /48
\item You can move this space from provider to provider\\
more easily than migrating from their IP space to some new providers space
\item You can have this announced via multiple providers -- redundancy

\slide{Concrete advice for enterprise networks}


\begin{list2}
\item Portscanning - start using portscans in your networks, verify how far malware and hackers can travel, and identify soft systems needing updates or isolation
\item Have separation -- anywhere, starting with organisation units, management networks, server networks, customers, guests, LAN, WAN, Mail, web, ...
\item Use Web proxies - do not allow HTTP directly except for a short allow list, \\
do not allow traffic to and from any new TLD
\item Use only your own DNS servers, create a pair of Unbound servers, \\
point your internal DNS running on Windows to these\\
Create filtering, logging, restrictions on these Unbound DNS servers\\
\link{https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/} and also \link{https://pi-hole.net/}
\item Only allow SMTP via your own mail servers, create a simple forwarder if you must
\end{list2}

Allow lists are better than block list, even if it takes some time to do it


\slide{DROP SOME TRAFFIC NOW}

\begin{list2}
\item Drop some traffic on the border of everything
\item Seriously do NOT allow Windows RPC across borders
\item Border here may be from regional country office back to HQ
\item Border may be from internet to internal networks
\item Block Windows RPC ports, 135, 137, 139, 445
\item Block DNS directly to internet, do not allow clients to use any DNS, fake 8.8.8.8 if you must internally
\item Block SMTP directly to internet
\item Create allow list for internal networks, client networks should not contact other client networks but only relevant server networks
\end{list2}

You DONT need to allow direct DNS towards internet, except from your own recursive DNS servers

If you get hacked by Windows RPC in 2022, you probably deserve it, sorry for being blunt

Best would be to analyze traffic and create allow lists, some internal networks to not need internet at all


\slide{Default permit}

%\hlkimage{}{}

One of the early implementers of firewalls Marcus J. Ranum summarized in 2005 The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security \link{https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/} which includes the always appropriate discussion about default permit versus default deny.

\begin{quote}\small {\bf
\#1) Default Permit}\\
This dumb idea crops up in a lot of different forms; it’s incredibly persistent and difficult to eradicate. Why? Because it’s so attractive. Systems based on ”Default Permit” are the computer security equivalent of empty calories: tasty, yet fattening.

The most recognizable form in which the ”Default Permit” dumb idea manifests itself is in firewall rules. Back in the very early days of computer security, network managers would set up an internet connection and decide to secure it by turning off incoming telnet, incoming rlogin, and incoming FTP. Everything else was allowed through, hence the name ”Default Permit.” This put the security practitioner in an endless arms-race with the hackers.
\end{quote}


\begin{list2}
\item Allow all current networks today on all ports for all protocols \emph{is} an allow list \\
Which tomorrow can be split into one for TCP, UDP and remaining, and measured upon
\item Measure, improve, repeat
\end{list2}



\slide{We cannot do X}

\begin{quote}
We cannot block SMTP from internal networks, since we do not know for sure if vendor X equipment needs to send the MOST important email alert at some unspecific time in the future
\end{quote}

Cool, then we can do an allow list starting today on our border firewall:
\begin{alltt}
table <smtp-exchange> \{ $exchange1 $exchange2 $exchange3 \}
table <smtp-unknown> persist file "/firewall/mail/smtp-internal-unknown.txt"
# Regular use, allowed
pass out on egress inet proto tcp from smtp-echange to any port 25/tcp
# Unknown, remove when phased out
pass out on egress inet proto tcp from smtp-internal to any port 25/tcp
\end{alltt}

Year 0 the unknown list may be 100\% of all internal networks, but new networks added to infrastructure are NOT added, so list will shrink -- evaluate the list, and compare to network logs, did networks send ANY SMTP for 1,2,3 years?


\slide{Conclusion}

% \hlkrightimage{15cm}{network-layers-1.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Implement firewalls -- take control over network packets
\item Read the Fine manuals -- your devices already has a lot to offer
\item Make a policy for networks, make incremental changes, configure security for new parts and VLANs in the network\\
Over time the older ones will be phased out, replaced or can have the same configuration applied with little trouble
\item Start from the bottom and from client ports, or from server ports if you like
\item Learn some Linux and use open source projects, really, will save you thosands of USD/EUR/DKK
