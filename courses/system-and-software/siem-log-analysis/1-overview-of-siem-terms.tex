Data-Driven Security: Analysis, Visualization and Dashboards has been designed to take you on a journey
into the world of security data science. The start of the journey looks a bit like the word cloud shown in Figure 1, which was created from the text in the chapters of this book. You have a great deal of information available to you, and may be able to pick out a signal or two within the somewhat hazy noise on your own.

However, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack without a magnet.

\begin{quote}
A discussion of which programming language is better than another for a certain set of tasks often turns (quickly) into a religious war of words that rarely wins converts and never becomes fully resolved. As a security data scientist, you will find that you do not have the luxury of language bias. There will be times when one language shines in one area while a different one shines in another, and you need the skills of a diplomat to bring them both together to solve real problems.

\slide{SIEM}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Security information and event management (SIEM)} is a subsection within the field of computer security, where software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.

  Vendors sell SIEM as software, as appliances, or as managed services; these products are also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance purposes.[1]

  The term and the initialism SIEM was coined by Mark Nicolett and Amrit Williams of Gartner in 2005.[2]

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
An information security operations center (ISOC or SOC) is a facility where enterprise information systems (web sites, applications, databases, data centers and servers, networks, desktops and other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended.

...

A security operations center (SOC) can also be called a security defense center (SDC), security analytics center (SAC), network security operations center (NSOC),[3] security intelligence center, cyber security center, threat defense center, security intelligence and operations center (SIOC). In the Canadian Federal Government the term, infrastructure protection center (IPC), is used to describe a SOC.

\begin{list1}
\item Example systems: Unix syslog, IBM main frame RACF and Windows Event Logs service
\item \emph{swatchdog} is an old skool, but simple tool that works
\item Logs should be protected and considered confidential information
\end{list1}



\slide{Anatomy of an Auditing System}

When data has been gathered it should be analyzed.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Logger functions} - collect
\item {\bf Analyzer} - analyze it, creating dashboard can provide some insights
\item {\bf Notifier} - report results by email or other means
\item Example systems Windows Event Logs service can inform of successful and failed logins, both should be collected
\item Logs should be protected and considered confidential information, by sending it to a centralized system with a high security level protects it
\end{itemize}

Modern systems exist to take all data from logging and provide high capacity storage, searching and sorting.

\slide{Why Elasticsearch}

\hlkimage{8cm}{illustrated-screenshot-hero-siem-500x730.png}
Screenshot from \url{https://www.elastic.co/siem}

Recommend building a proof-of-concept infrastructure using the Elastic stack and gather experience with logging. This can be done without a license fee and the organization can then see what works and doesn't. Then using the experiences as input an informed decision can be made, to continue with this as a home grown logging and auditing solution, or buy a premade one.


\slide{Technologies used in this course}

The following tools and environments are examples that may be introduced in this course:

\begin{list2}
\item Programming languages and frameworks Java, Python, regular expressions
\item Development environments -- choose your own IDE / Editor -- I use {\bf Atom}
\item Networking and network protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, Netflow
\item Formats XML, JSON, CSV, raw text, web scraping
\item Web technologies and services: REST, API, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
\item Tools like cURL, Zeek, Git and Github
\item Message queueing systems: MQ and Redis could be added
\item Aggregated example platforms: Elastic stack, logstash, elasticsearch, kibana, grafana, Filebeat
\item Cloud and virtualisation Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, AWS, microservices -- can be added

\slide{Detection Capabilities}


Security incidents happen, but what happens. One of the actions to reduce impact of incidents are done in preparing for incidents.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Preparation} for an attack, establish procedures and mechanisms for detecting and responding to attacks
\end{itemize}

Preparation will enable easy {\bf identification} of affected systems, better {\bf containment} which systems are likely to be infected, {\bf eradication} what happened -- how to do the {\bf eradication} and {\bf recovery}.

\slide{Strategy for implementing identification and detection}

We recommend that the following strategy is used for implementing identification and detection.

We have the following recommendations and actions points for logging:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\faSquareO] Enable system logging from servers
\item[\faSquareO] Enable system logging from network devices
\item[\faSquareO] Centralize logging
\item[\faSquareO] Add search facilities and dashboards
\item[\faSquareO] Perform system audits manually or automatically
\item[\faSquareO] Setup notification and notification procedures
\end{enumerate}

\slide{Extended Sources}
When a basic logging infrastructure is setup, it can be expanded to increase coverage, by
adding more sources:

\begin{list2}
\item DNS query logging -- will enable multiple cases to be resolved, example malware identification and tracing, when was a malware domain queried, when was the first infection
\item Session data from Firewalls, Netflow -- traffic patterns can be investigated and both attacks and cases like exfiltration can likely be seen
\end{list2}

Hint: Take the sources available first, make a proof-of-concept, expand coverage

\slide{Data Analysis Skills}

\begin{quote}
Although we could spend an entire book creating an exhaustive list of skills needed to be a good security data scientist, this chapter covers the following skills/domains that a data scientist will benefit from
knowing within information security:
\begin{list2}
\item Domain expertise—Setting and maintaining a purpose to the analysis
\item Data management—Being able to prepare, store, and maintain data
\item Programming—The glue that connects data to analysis
\item Statistics—To learn from the data
\item Visualization—Communicating the results effectively
\end{list2}
It might be easy to label any one of these skills as the most important, but in reality, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each of these contributes a significant and important piece to the workings of
security data science.

\slide{XML data}

\begin{quote}
  Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0 Specification[2] of 1998[3] and several other related specifications[4]—all of them free open standards—define XML.[5]

  The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet.[6] It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures[7] such as those used in web services.

\slide{XML data - documents}

\begin{quote}
Hundreds of document formats using XML syntax have been developed,[8] including RSS, Atom, SOAP, SVG, and XHTML. XML-based formats have become the default for many office-productivity tools, including Microsoft Office (Office Open XML), OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice (OpenDocument), and Apple's iWork[citation needed]. XML has also provided the base language for communication protocols such as XMPP. Applications for the Microsoft .NET Framework use XML files for configuration, and property lists are an implementation of configuration storage built on XML.[9]

\begin{quote}
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/[note 1]) is an open-standard file format or data interchange format that uses {\bf human-readable text} to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as replacement for XML in AJAX systems.[6]

\item Example uses xml.etree.ElementTree from Python \url{https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html}
\end{list2}

\slide{Convert XML to JSON}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import json
def etree_to_dict(t):
    d = {t.tag : map(etree_to_dict, t.getchildren())}
    d.update(('@' + k, v) for k, v in t.attrib.items())
    d['text'] = t.text
    return d

tree = ET.parse('testfile.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
mydict = etree_to_dict(root)
print(type(tree))
print(type(root))
print(type(mydict))

print(mydict)

with open('testfile.json', 'w') as json_file:
  json.dump(mydict, json_file)
\end{minted}

Converting using Python is easy



\slide{Side note: Zeek Security Monitor handles formats differently}

Zeek has files formatted with a header:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
#fields ts      uid     id.orig_h       id.orig_p       id.resp_h       id.resp_p       proto   trans_id
        rtt     query   qclass  qclass_name     qtype   qtype_name      rcode   rcode_name      AA
        TC      RD      RA      Z       answers TTLs    rejected

1538982372.416180	CD12Dc1SpQm42QW4G3	10.xxx.0.145	57476	10.x.y.141	53	udp	20383
	0.045021	www.dr.dk	1	C_INTERNET	1	A	0	NOERROR	F	F	T	T	0

\end{alltt}

Note: this show ALL the fields captured and dissected by Zeek, there is a nice utility program bro-cut which can select specific fields:

\begin{alltt}\small
root@NMS-VM:/var/spool/bro/bro# cat dns.log | bro-cut -d ts query answers | grep dr.dk
2018-10-08T09:06:12+0200	www.dr.dk	www.dr.dk-v1.edgekey.net,e16198.b.akamaiedge.net,2.17.212.93
\end{alltt}

Can also just use JSON now via Filebeat

\slide{Git intro}

\begin{quote}
Git (/ɡɪt/)[7] is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.[8] It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[11]
