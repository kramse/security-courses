\slide{Face reality}

From the definition:
\begin{quote}
suspicion and mistrust of people or their actions {\bf without evidence or justification}.
{\bf the global paranoia about hackers and viruses}
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item It is not paranoia when:
\begin{list2}
\item Criminals sell your credit card information and identity theft
\item Trade infected computers like a commodity
\item Governments write laws that allows them to introduce back-doors - and use these
\item Governments do blanket surveillance of their population, implement censorship, threaten citizens and journalist
\end{list2}

I recommend we have appropriate paranoia (DK: passende paranoia)



\slide{Overlapping Security Incidents}

\hlkrightpic{12cm}{1cm}{datalaek-2019.png}

New data breaches nearly every week, these from danish news site \link{version2.dk}

Problem, we need to receive data from others

Data from others may contain malware

Have a job posting, yes\\
- then HR will be expecting CVs sent as .doc files

\slide{Good security}

\hlkimage{15cm}{god-sikkerhed.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item You always have limited resources for protection - use them as best as possible
\end{list1}



\slide{Recommendations}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Keep updated!}\\ - read web sites, books, articles, mailing lists, Twitter, ...
\item {\bf Always have a chapter on security evaluation }\\ - any process must have security, like RFC Request for Comments have
\item {\bf Incident Response}\\ - you WILL have security incidents, be prepared
\item {\bf Write down security policy}\\ - including software and e-mail policies
\end{list1}


\slide{Advice}

\begin{list1}
\item Use technology
\item Learn the technology - read the freaking manual
\item Think about the data you have, upload, facebook license?! WTF!
\item Think about the data you create - nude pictures taken, where will they show up?
\begin{list2}
\item Turn off features you don't use
\item Turn off network connections when not in use
\item Update software and applications
\item Turn on encryption: IMAP{\bf S}, POP3{\bf S},
  HTTP{\bf S} also for data at rest, full disk encryption, tablet encryption
\item Lock devices automatically when not used for 10 minutes
\item Dont trust fancy logins like fingerprint scanner or face recognition on cheap devices
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

But which features to disable? Let the security principles guide you

\slide{Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability}

\hlkimage{8cm}{cia-triad-uk.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item We want to protect something
\item Confidentiality - data kept a secret
\item Integrity - data is not subjected to unauthorized changes
\item Availability - data and systems are available when needed
\end{list1}

\slide{What is data?}
\hlkimage{5cm}{Linus3-04041999.jpg}

\slide{Work together}

\hlkimage{9cm}{Shaking-hands_web.jpg}

\begin{list1}
\item Team up!
\item We need to share security information freely
\item We often face the same threats, so we can work on solving these together
\end{list1}

\slide{Goals of Security}

\begin{list1}
\item Prevention - means that an attack will fail
\item Detection - determine if attack is underway, or has occured - report it
\item Recovery - stop attack, assess damage, repair damage
\end{list1}


\slide{Your data has already have been owned by criminals}

\hlkimage{13cm}{pwned.png}

\begin{list1}
\item Your data is already being sold, and resold on the Internet

\item Check you own email addresses on \link{https://haveibeenpwned.com/}
\end{list1}

\centerline{Go ahead try the web site - hold up your hand if you are in those dumps}



\slide{Balanced security}

\hlkimage{21cm}{afbalanceret-sikkerhed.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item Better to have the same level of security
\item If you have bad security in some part - guess where attackers will end up
\item Hackers are not required to take the hardest path into the network
\item Realize there is no such thing as 100\% security
\end{list1}

\slide{Cost-Benefit Analysis}
% ROI?

\begin{list1}
\item Benefits of computer security must be weighed against value of assets
\item Often more expensive to add security mechanisms to a system, than designing them in
\end{list1}





\slide{Initial Overview of Software Security}

\begin{list2}
\item Security Testing Versus Traditional Software Testing
\item Functional testing does not prevent security issues!
\item SQL Injection example, injecting commands into database
\item Attackers try to break the application, server, operating system, etc.
\item Use methods like user input, memory corruption / buffer overflow, poor exception handling, broken authentication, ...

\slide{Bots and botnets}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Definition 23-15} A \emph{bot} is malware that carries out some action in coordination with other bots. The attacker, called a \emph{botmaster}, controls the bots from one or more systems called \emph{command and control (C\&C) servers} or \emph{motherships}. They communicate over paths called \emph{C\&C channels}. A collection of bots is a \emph{botnet}.\\
Definition from Computer Security: Art and Science, Matt Bishop ISBN: 9780321712332
\item Internet Relay Chat has been popular for control channel to botnets
\item Botnets are popular for spamming campaigns or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks

\slide{Coding standards - style}

\begin{quote}
This file specifies the preferred style for kernel source files in the
OpenBSD source tree.  It is also a guide for preferred user land code
style.  These guidelines should be followed for all new code.  In general,
code can be considered ``new code'' when it makes up about 50% or
more of the file(s) involved. ...\\
Use queue(3) macros rather than rolling your own lists, whenever possible.
Thus, the previous example would be better written:
\end{quote}

\begin{verbatim}
    #include <sys/queue.h>
    struct  foo {
    LIST_ENTRY(foo) link;  /* Queue macro glue for foo lists */
               struct  mumble amumble; /* Comment for mumble */
               int     bar;
    };
    LIST_HEAD(, foo) foohead;     /* Head of global foo list */
\end{verbatim}


OpenBSD style(9)

\slide{Coding standards functions}

\begin{quote}
The following copies as many characters from input to buf as will fit and
NUL terminates the result.  Because strncpy() does not guarantee to NUL
terminate the string itself, it must be done by hand.
\end{quote}

\begin{verbatim}
        char buf[BUFSIZ];

        (void)strncpy(buf, input, sizeof(buf) - 1);
        buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';
\end{verbatim}
\begin{quote}
Note that strlcpy(3) is a better choice for this kind of operation.  The
equivalent using strlcpy(3) is simply:
\end{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
        (void)strlcpy(buf, input, sizeof(buf));

\begin{alltt}
In a Java project I work on, we use log4j extensively.  Use of
System.out.println() bypasses the control that we get from log4j,
so we would like to discourage the addition of println calls in
our code.

We want to deny any commits that add a println into the code.
The world being full of exceptions, we do need a way to allow
some uses of println, so we will allow it if the line of code
that calls println ends in a comment that says it is ok:

   System.out.println("No log4j here"); // (authorized)

\slide{Produktionsmodning af miljøer}

\begin{list1}
\item Tænk på det miljø som servere og services skal udsættes for
\item Sørg for hærdning og tænk generel sikring:
  \begin{list2}
  \item Opdateret software - ingen kendte sikkerhedshuller eller
  sårbarheder
\item Fjern {\bfseries single points of failure} - redundant strøm, ekstra enheder, to DNS servere fremfor en
\item Adskilte servere - interne og eksterne til forskellige formål
\item Lav filtre på netværket, eller på data - firewalls og proxy
  funktioner
\item Begræns adgangen til at læse information
\item Begræns adgangen til at skrive information - eksempelvis databaser
\item Brug {\bfseries least privileges} - sørg for at programmer og brugere
  kun har de nødvendige rettigheder til at kunne udføre opgaver
\item Følg med på områderne der har relevans for virksomheden og
  \emph{jeres} installation
  \end{list2}
  \item Meld jer på security mailinglister for de produkter I benytter, også open source
\end{list1}


\slide{Change management}

\begin{list1}
\item Er der tilstrækkeligt med fokus på software i produktion

\slide{Design a robust network Isolation and segmentation}

\begin{list1}
\item Hvad kan man gøre for at få bedre netværkssikkerhed?
\begin{list2}
\item Bruge switche - der skal ARP spoofes og bedre performance
\item Opdele med firewall til flere DMZ zoner for at holde
      udsatte servere adskilt fra hinanden, det interne netværk og
      Internet
\item Overvåge, læse logs og reagere på hændelser
\end{list2}
\item Husk du skal også kunne opdatere dine servere
\end{list1}

\slide{Basic Network Security Pattern Isolate in VLANs}

\hlkimage{10cm}{images/demo-netvaerk.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item Du bør opdele dit netværk i segmenter efter trafik
\item Du bør altid holde interne og eksterne systemer adskilt!
\item Du bør isolere farlige services i jails og chroots
\item Brug port security til at sikre basale services DHCP, Spanning Tree osv.
\end{list1}



\slide{Building Secure Infrastructures}

\begin{list1}
\item We did an exercise last time, starting to build a DMZ for servers
\item A real-life setup of an infrastructure from scratch can be daunting!
\item You need:
\begin{list2}
\item Policies
\item Procedures
\item Incident Response
\end{list2}
\item Running systems which require
\begin{list2}
\item Configurations
\item Settings
\item Supporting infrastructure -- networks
\item Supporting infrastructure -- logging, dashboarding, monitoring
\end{list2}
\item Building something \emph{secure} is {\bf hard work!}
\end{list1}



\slide{Existing infrastructures}

\begin{list1}
\item or even worse you inherited an infrastructure
\item Multiple networks, with different vendors, rules
\item Multiple generations of services, applications, technologies
\item Built over decades
\item Varying to no documentation
\item Organizational challenges
\item Ingrained culture -- frozen in time
\end{list1}

How do you get started improving security?

\slide{Integrate or develop?}

\begin{list1}
\item Dont:
\begin{list2}
\item Reinvent the wheel - too many times, unless you can maintain it afterwards
\item Never invent cryptography yourself
\item No copy paste of functionality, harder to maintain in the future
\end{list2}
\item Do:
\begin{list2}
\item Integrate with existing solutions
\item Use existing well-tested code: cryptography, authentication, hashing
\item Centralize security in your code and organization
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

\slide{Center for Internet Security CIS Controls}

\begin{quote}
  The CIS ControlsTM are a prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set
of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks. The
CIS Controls are developed by a community of IT experts who apply their first-hand experience
as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices. The experts who
develop the CIS Controls come from a wide range of sectors including retail, manufacturing,
healthcare, education, government, defense, and others.

\slide{Center for Internet Security CIS Controls 7.1}

\begin{list2}
%\item The five critical tenets of an effective cyber defense system as reflected in the CIS Controls are:
\item {\bf Offense informs defense:} Use knowledge of actual attacks that have
compromised systems to provide the foundation to continually learn
from these events to build effective, practical defenses. Include only
those controls that can be shown to stop known real-world attacks.
\item {\bf Prioritization:} Invest first in Controls that will provide the greatest risk
reduction and protection against the most dangerous threat actors
and that can be feasibly implemented in your computing environment.
The CIS Implementation Groups discussed below are a great place for
organizations to start identifying relevant Sub-Controls.
\item {\bf Measurements and Metrics:} Establish common metrics to provide a
shared language for executives, IT specialists, auditors, and security
officials to measure the effectiveness of security measures within
an organization so that required adjustments can be identified and
implemented quickly.
\item {\bf Continuous diagnostics and mitigation:} Carry out continuous
measurement to test and validate the effectiveness of current security
measures and to help drive the priority of next steps.
\item {\bf Automation:} Automate defenses so that organizations can achieve
reliable, scalable, and continuous measurements of their adherence to
the Controls and related metrics. \hskip 2cm Source: CIS-Controls-Version-7-1.pdf
