\chapter*{Hand-in 1: Django newsletter signup application}

{\bf Assignment:}\\
Create a basic Application using the Django project framework.

The application must include a form for signup to a newsletter, and save this information.

The fields to accept are

\begin{list2}
\item Username
\item First names
\item Last names
\item Email
\end{list2}

A script for adding test data to this system should also be developed - make sure it contains some bad data too.

Must be handed in as PDF and code at latest on October 1st, 2019. Teams up to two are allowed. Make sure to list team members in the report.

Expect PDF as A4, portrait mode up to 5-10 pages with illustrations as needed.

Recommend to use a report template with table of contents, front matter, page numbers etc.

Code must be handed in as zip or link to repository, if private Github repository used should allow access to user \verb+kramse+

Help:\\
Using the Django admin site can help by showing data entered in your application. You dont need to program much more than a single form and possibly a front page or menu.

\chapter*{Hand-in 2: Django input validation}


{\bf Assignment:}\\
Extend your basic Application using the Django project framework to use input validation.

The application for newsletter signup has had some problems with data quality and possibly exploits.

To alleviate this you must extend your application and environment:
\begin{list2}
\item Implement input validation in your application so any future data entered is validated before being saved
\item Create a method, script or program to evaluate existing data
\item Write a procedure for data conversion/check and perform this as a \emph{production change} on your system - with documentation how the change was performed. Include this in the report as an appendix.
\end{list2}

Must be handed in as one PDF and one code zip or repository at latest on October 8st, 2019. Teams up to two are allowed. Make sure to list team members in the report.

Expect PDF as A4, portrait mode up to 5-10 pages with illustrations as needed.
Recommend to use a report template with table of contents, front matter, page numbers etc.

Code must be handed in as zip or link to repository, if private Github repository used should allow access to user \verb+kramse+
