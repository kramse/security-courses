\slide{UK: Seize smart phones and download data}

\begin{quote}
Officers use counter-terrorism laws to remove a mobile phone from any passenger they wish coming through UK air, sea and international rail ports and then scour their data.

The blanket power is so broad they do not even have to show reasonable suspicion for seizing the device and can retain the information for "as long as is necessary".

Data can include call history, contact books, photos and who the person is texting or emailing, although not the contents of messages.

(Reuters) - British authorities came under pressure on Monday to explain why anti-terrorism powers were used to detain for nine hours the partner of a journalist who has written articles about {\bf U.S. and British surveillance programs} based on {\bf leaks from Edward Snowden}.

Restoring Trust in Government and the Internet
In July 2012, responding to allegations that the video-chat service Skype -- owned by Microsoft -- was changing its protocols to make it possible for the government to eavesdrop on users, Corporate Vice President Mark Gillett took to the company's blog to deny it.

Turns out that wasn't quite true.

Hackers do not discriminate

\begin{list1}
\item We have seen lots of hacker stories, and we learn:
\item We are all targets of hacking

\slide{First advice}

\begin{list1}
\item Use technology
\item Learn the technology - read the freaking manual

\item Think about the data you create - nude pictures taken, where will they show up?
\begin{list2}
\item Turn off features you don't use
\item Turn off network connections when not in use
\item Update software and applications
\item Turn on encryption: IMAP{\bf S}, POP3{\bf S},
  HTTP{\bf S} also for data at rest, full disk encryption, tablet encryption
\item Lock devices automatically when not used for 10 minutes
\item Dont trust fancy logins like fingerprint scanner or face recognition on cheap devices
\end{list2}

\slide{Why think of security?}

\hlkimage{8cm}{1984-not-instruction-manual.jpg}


\begin{quote}
	Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. ~A Cypherpunk's Manifesto by Eric Hughes, 1993

The YubiKey NEO can be tapped on an NFC-enabled smartphone, which reads an encrypted one-time password emitted from the key fob."

\centerline{Conclusion passwords: integrate with authentication, not reinvent}


\begin{list1}
\item Dont:
\begin{list2}
\item Reinvent the wheel - too many times, unless you can maintain it afterwards
\item Never invent cryptography yourself
\item No copy paste of functionality, harder to maintain in the future
\end{list2}
\item Do:
\begin{list2}
\item Integrate with existing solutions
\item Use existing well-tested code: cryptography, authentication, hashing
\item Centralize security in your code
\item Fine to hide which authentication framework is being used, easy to replace later
\end{list2}

\slide{Cisco IOS password}

\begin{quote}
Title: Cisco's new password hashing scheme easily cracked\\

Description: In an astonishing decision that has left crytographic
experts scratching their heads, engineer's for Cisco's IOS operating
system chose to switch to a {\bf one-time SHA256 encoding - without salt} -
for storing passwords on the device. This decision leaves password
hashes vulnerable to high-speed cracking - modern graphics cards can
compute over {\bf 2 billion SHA256 hashes in a second - and is actually
considerably less secure than Cisco's previous implementation.} As users
cannot downgrade their version of IOS without a complete reinstall, and
no fix is yet available, security experts are urging users to avoid
upgrades to IOS version 15 at this time.

\slide{buffer overflows is a C problem}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bfseries Et buffer overflow}
is what happens if some internal structure in programs are modified by an attacker for the purpose 
of taking control of the application and system. Often a program will crash, but if the attacker can input specific data it might be possible to point to their own {\bf shell code} containing instructions to be executed.
\item {\bfseries Stack protection} today both a specific technique and generic term for 
adding protection to operating systems and programs to reduce the likelihood of buffer overflows succeeding. The main features are protecting areas in memory by making them non-writeable and non-executable. StackGuard
and Propolice are some popular choices
\end{list1}


\slide{Buffer og stacks}

\{      char buf[200];

\}

\begin{list1}
\item Bad function overwrites return value!
\item Control return address
\item Run shellcode from buffer, or from other place
\end{list1}


\slide{Exploits - exploiting vulnerabilities}

\begin{list1}
\item an exploit is a program designed to abuse some weakness or vulnerability
\begin{list2}
\item Usually the expliot will demonstrate the weakness found, proof-of-concept (PoC)
\item Usually the exploit will only include one vulnerability and is targeted at specific versions of the vulnerable program
\item Exploits can be a few lines of code or multiple pages
\item Used to be written using Perl and C, but today popular choices include Ruby and Python
\item Can often be plugged into the Metasploit framework for direct execution
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

$buffer = ""; 
$null = "\textbackslash{}x00"; \pause

# Fill buffer

\slide{Principle of least privilege}

\begin{list1}
\item Why execute applications with administrative rights - if they only need to read from a database
\item {\bfseries principle of least privilege} 
execute code only with the most restrictive set of permissions required to perform a task
\end{list1}

\slide{Privilege escalation}
\begin{list1}
\item {\bfseries privilege escalation} is what an attacker aims to perform
\item Trying to get from an authenticated user to a higher privileged administrative user id
\item Some functions in operating systems require higher privileges, and they can sometimes be persuaded to fail in spectacular ways
\item When an attacker can execute commands they can often find a way to exploit software and escalate privileges
\end{list1}


\slide{local vs. remote exploits}

\begin{list1} 
\item {\bfseries local vs. remote}
signifies if the specific attack exploited is done from the operating system using a local command/feature or if this is done remotely across some network connection
\item {\bfseries remote root exploit} 
- feared because it would grant administrative rights across a network connection
\item More often an attacker will combine a remote exploit with a privilege escalation exploit
\item {\bfseries zero-day exploits} 0-days are not made public, but kept in small groups and suddenly can be found in use on the internet, or in specific use for a targeted attack
\item Since nobody is aware of the problem, there is no fix readily available from the vendors/programmers
\end{list1}

\item Yasca can scan source code written in Java, C/C++, HTML, JavaScript, ASP, ColdFusion, PHP, COBOL, .NET, and other languages. Yasca can integrate easily with other tools\\
