\hlkimage{12cm}{images/cia-triad-uk.pdf}

Everything today is cloud - but did we loose security? and what is security?

Did you ask security questions? Did you even think about security when deciding to do cloud computing?


\slide{Take Charge of Your Security}

We have more customers asking about 
\begin{list2}
\item ISO/IEC 27001 - information security management system standards\\
\link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001}
\item SSAE 16 No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization\\ 
Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) \link{http://ssae16.com/}
\item ISAE 3402 Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization\\
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
\link{http://isae3402.com/}
\item Independent assessment from a trusted security firm - which must often also be certified
\item Physical Security, power, HVAC - trusted partners reviewing security
\item Implementing standards is also security
\end{list2}

Over the years organisations have become more mature with regards to security

Implementing security controls were easier when you owned all resources

  separate nøgler til kryptering og dekryptering
\end{list1}

\slide{Public key kryptografi - 2}

\hlkimage{18cm}{images/crypto-public-key-2.pdf}

\begin{list1}
