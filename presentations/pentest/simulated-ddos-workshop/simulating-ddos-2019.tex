% Simulating DDoS Attacks
% A small workshop teaching people how to produce DDoS simulation traffic - usefull for testing their own infrastructures.

% We will have a server connected on 10Gbit on a switch with multiple 1Gbit port for attackers. Attackers will be connected through 1Gbit ports using USB Ethernet - we have loaners.

% Work together to produce enough to take down this server!

% WHILE attack is ongoing there will be both the possibility to monitor traffic, monitor port, and decide on changes to prevent the attacks from working.

% We will work through common attack types, like:

% * TCP SYN flooding
% * TCP other flooding
% * UDP flooding NTP, etc.
% * ICMP flooding
% * Misc - stranger attacks and illegal combinations of flags etc.

% then we will discuss and implement changes suggested and retry attacks.

%You will go away from this with tools for producing packets, hping3 and some configurations for protecting - PF rules, switch rules, server firewall rules.



% Bio, Henrik Kramshoej

% Henrik is a grumpy old internet samurai working with internet security.
% Henrik loves IPv6 and sending small packets to discover open ports and find security vulnerabilities

\slide{What is pentest}

\begin{quote}
A penetration test, informally pen test, is an attack on a computer system that looks for security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to the computer's features and data.[1][2]
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Penetration testing is a simulation, with good intentions
\item People around the world constantly \emph{test your defenses}
\item Often better to test at planned times
\end{list1}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
usage: hping3 host [options]
  -i  --interval  wait (uX for X microseconds, for example -i u1000)
      --fast      alias for -i u10000 (10 packets for second)
      --faster    alias for -i u1000 (100 packets for second)
      --flood	   sent packets as fast as possible. Don't show replies.
...
hping3 is fully scriptable using the TCL language, and packets
can be received and sent via a binary or string representation
describing the packets.

T50 Experimental Mixed Packet Injector Tool 5.4.1
Originally created by Nelson Brito <nbrito@sekure.org>
Maintained by Fernando Mercês <fernando@mentebinaria.com.br>

Usage: T50 <host> [/CIDR] [options]

Common Options:
    --threshold NUM        Threshold of packets to send     (default 1000)
    --flood                This option supersedes the 'threshold'
...
6. Running T50 with '--protocol T50' option, sends ALL protocols sequentially.

\slide{Process: monitor, attack, break, repeat}

\begin{list2}
\item Pre-test: Monitoring setup - from multiple points
\item Pre-test: Perform full Nmap scan of network and ports
\item Start small, run with delays between packets
\item Turn up until it breaks, decrease delay - until using \verb+--flood+
\item Monitor speed of attack on your router interface pps/bandwidth
\item Give it maximum speed\\
 \verb+hping3 --flood -1+ and \verb+hping3 --flood -2+
\item Have a common chat with network operators/customer to talk about symptoms and things observed
\item Any information resulting from testing is good information

\slide{Running full port scan on network}

\begin{alltt}
\small
# export CUST_NET="192.0.2.0/24"
# nmap -p 1-65535 -A -oA full-scan $CUST_NET
\end{alltt}

Performs a full port scan of the network, all ports

Saves output in "all formats" normal, XML, and grepable formats

Goal is to enumerate the ports that are allowed through the network.

Note: This command is pretty harmless, if something dies, then it is\\
\emph{vulnerable to normal traffic} - and should be fixed!

\slide{Recommendations During Test}

\begin{list1}
\item Run each test for at least 5 minutes, or even 15 minutes\\
Some attacks require some build-up before resource run out
\item Take note of any change in response, higher latency, lost probes
\item If you see a change, then re-test using the same parameters, or a little less first
\item We want to know the approximate level where it breaks
\item If you want to change environment, then wait until all scenarios tested
\end{list1}

\slide{Comparable to real DDoS?}

Tools are simple and widely available but are they actually producing same result as high-powered and advanced criminal botnets. We can confirm that the attack delivered in this test is, in fact, producing the traffic patterns very close to criminal attacks in real-life scenarios.

\begin{list2}
\item We can also monitor logs when running a single test-case
\item Gain knowledge about supporting infrastructure
\item Can your syslog infrastructure handle 800.000 events in $<$ 1 hour?
\end{list2}

\slide{Experiences from testing}

How much bandwidth can big danish companies handle?
\begin{list2}
\item A) 10-100Mbps
\item B) 100Mbps -1Gbit
\item C) Up to 5Gbit easily
\end{list2}

How much abuse in pps can big danish companies handle?
\begin{list2}
\item A) 10.000 - 50.000 pps
\item B) 50 - 500k pps
\item C) Up to 5 million pps
\end{list2}

\slide{Running the tools}

A basic test would be:
\begin{list2}
\item TCP SYN flooding
\item TCP other flags, PUSH-ACK, RST, ACK, FIN
\item ICMP flooding
\item UDP flooding
\item Spoofed packets src=dst=target \smiley
\item Small fragments
\item Bad fragment offset
\item Bad checksum
\item Be creative
\item Mixed packets - like \verb+t50 --protocol T50+
\item Perhaps esoteric or unused protocols, GRE, IPSec
\end{list2}

\slide{Test-cases / Scenarios}

\begin{list1}
\item The minimal run contains at least these:
\begin{list2}
\item SYN flood: \verb+hping3 -q -c 1000000  -i u60 -S -p 80  $CUST_IP &+
\item SYN+ACK: \verb+hping3 -q -c 1000000  -i u60 -S -A -p 80  $CUST_IP &+
\item ICMP flood: \verb+hping3 -q -c 1000000 --flood -1 $CUST_IP &+
\item UDP flood: \verb+hping3 -q -c 1000000 --flood -2 $CUST_IP &+
\end{list2}
\item Vary the speed using the packet interval \verb+-i u60+ up/down
\item Use flooding with caution, runs max speeeeeeeeeeeed \smiley
\item TCP testing use a port which is allowed through the network, often 80/443
\item Focus on attacks which are hard to block, example TCP SYN must be allowed in
\item Also if you found devices like routers in front of environment\\
\verb+hping3 -q -c 1000000  -i u60 -S -p 22 $ROUTER_IP+\\
\verb+hping3 -q -c 1000000  -i u60 -S -p 179 $ROUTER_IP+
\end{list1}

\slide{Test-cases / Scenarios, continued Spoof Source}

Spoofed packets src=dst=target \smiley

Flooding with spoofed packet source, within customer range

\begin{alltt}\small

-a --spoof hostname
    Use this option in order to set a fake IP  source  address,  this
    option ensures that target will not gain your real address.
\end{alltt}

\verb+hping3 -q --flood -p 80 -S -a $CUST_IP $CUST_IP+

Preferably using a test-case you know fails, to see effect

Still amazed how often this works

BCP38 anyone!

\slide{Test-cases / Scenarios, continued Small Fragments}

Using the built-in option -f for hping

\begin{alltt}\small
-f --frag
    Split  packets  in more fragments, this may be useful in order to test IP
    stacks fragmentation performance and to test if some packet filter is  so
    weak  that  can  be  passed using tiny fragments (anachronistic). Default
    {\bf 'virtual mtu' is 16 bytes}. see also --mtu option.
\end{alltt}

\begin{list1}
\item \verb+hping3 -q --flood -p 80 -S -f $CUST_IP+
\item Similar process with bad checksum and Bad fragment offset
\end{list1}

\slide{Experiences from testing}

How much bandwidth can big danish companies handle!\\
{\bf 100Mbps -1Gbit}

How much abuse in pps can big danish companies handle!\\
B) {\bf 50.000 - 500k pps} TCP attacks\\
B) {\bf 500.000 - 1mill pps} UDP or ICMP attacks\\
Ohhh and often we can spoof using their addresses in the first test

Even the DDoS protection services are a bit too small, can handle perhaps only 10G and also multiple times admins lost access to network, VPN, log overflow etc.

\vskip 1cm
Note: attackers can send full 10Gbit 14mill pps from Core i7 with 3 cores ...

%\item Some chat: IRC - some random channel

\slide{Improvements seen after testing}

\begin{list1}
\item Turning off unneeded features - free up resources
\item Tuning sesions, max sessions src / dst
\item Tuning firewalls, max sessions in half-open state, enabling services
\item Tuning network, drop spoofed src from inside net \smiley
\item Tuning network, can follow logs, manage network during attacks
\item ...
\item And organisation has better understanding of DDoS challenges
\item Including vendors, firewall consultants, ISPs etc.

.
\begin{list1}
\item You really should try testing
\item Investigate your existing devices\\
all of them, RTFM, upgrade firmware
\item Choose which devices does which\\
part - discard early to free resources\\
for later devices to dig deeper
